    <h2>What You Need to Make Banana Pancakes</h2>

    <p>If you have ready-to-use bananas and a few kitchen staples, you already have 
        everything you need to make perfect banana pancakes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour</b><p>All-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the 
            pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</p></li>
        <li><b>Sugar</b><p>Granulated sugar adds sweetness, helps hold in moisture, and 
            may create a tender texture.</p></li>
        <li><b>Baking Powder</b><p>Baking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in 
            the batter, which ensures light and fluffy pancakes.</p></li>
        <li><b>Salt</b><p>Salt adds subtle depth to all sorts of sweet dishes, including 
            pancakes. You won't be able to detect it in the finished product, 
            but you'll miss it if you leave it out.</p></li>
        <li><b>An Egg</b><p>Eggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure. 
            The fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture.</p></li>
        <li><b>Milk</b><p>Not only does milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential 
            for dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive batter.</p></li>
        <li><b>Vegetable Oil</b><p>Vegetable oil is harder to burn than butter, so it's a great 
            fat to use in banana pancakes. It keeps the pancakes moist and prevents them 
            from sticking to the pan.</p></li>
        <li><b>Bananas</b><p>Last but certainly not least, you'll need two mashed bananas for 
            these pancakes. The bananas will help hold the other ingredients together and 
            add mellow, fruity flavor.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Banana Pancakes</h2>

    <p>It really couldn't be easier to make this basic banana pancake recipe. You'll find 
        the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><b>Mix</b>: Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) 
            in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) 
            in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients,

            alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.</li>
